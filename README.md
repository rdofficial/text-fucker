__A note from the author__ :
This project is made for fun and all other purposes, therefore I don't expect any kind of comments saying that the tool do makes the plain text file into a heavy file. This project is started as a fun way of mocking the people who want to read my personal files. Like, just imagine when some open a file named 'passwords.txt' and only thing they see is _fuckfuckfuck_ LOL!. Their reactions would bring laughing tears to my face. Jokes aside, you are still allowed to contribute to this repository and make the backend code even better. Just keep coding! and keep text fucking!.
